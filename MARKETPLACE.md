# Steam Big Picture Controller

Control Steam and Big Picture mode with a single smart button!

## What It Does

This plugin provides intelligent Steam control right from your Stream Deck:
- **Launch Steam** when it's not running
- **Enter Big Picture mode** with one press
- **Exit Big Picture** back to normal Steam
- **Close or exit Steam** with a long press (configurable)

## Key Features

### Smart Button Behavior
One button handles everything:
- Press when Steam is off → Launches Steam
- Press when Steam is running → Opens Big Picture
- Press when in Big Picture → Returns to normal mode
- Hold for 2 seconds → Close window or exit completely

### Visual Feedback
The button icon changes automatically to show Steam's current state:
- Greyed icon = Steam not running
- Normal icon = Steam running
- Highlighted icon = Big Picture mode active

### Configurable Options
- **Always open in Big Picture** - Skip normal Steam, go straight to Big Picture
- **Long-press action** - Choose what happens when you hold the button:
  - Do nothing (default)
  - Close Steam window
  - Exit Steam completely

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or later
- Steam installed
- Stream Deck software 6.0+

## Perfect For
